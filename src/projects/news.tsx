const news = "I've just added a new section of the site to the Other category: Zines! These are a collection of zines that I'm uploading and putting out there for free to be downloaded and distributed wherever people want to distribute them. All I ask is that you don't profit off them in any way. Some of these are political in nature and some of them are just for fun. There's also a free graphic with instructions on what to do with the zine once you've printed it out, how to fold it into a booklet, in case you've not made a zine before. I'm also working on my books, this time last year I thought I'd have the books ready to be reprinted but things have been pretty hectic so I haven't been able to make the time to properly do it but it is on my agenda for soon :)";
