# Illustration portfolio

Created myself a little illustration portfolio because I was bored of the prebuilt website makers. As convenient as they are, the free versions are pretty basic and some of the features I wanted to use were behind a paywall. Rather than pay for stuff I thought hey, I'm a developer, that's my whole actual job thing, I'm gonna do it myself! So here's what I've got so far.

## Getting Started

This is a next.js app with typescript. 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
